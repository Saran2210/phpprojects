		Before connecting an ohmmeter to a circuit, you should first
			Check the circuit with a voltmeter to make sure the circuit is not powered

			A corroded connection.
			A pin pushed out of a connector
		When checking a normally open relay (with four terminals) with and ohmmeter, no continuity will be shown between two terminals and the other two terminals will show
			Resistance somewhere between 40 ohms and 120 ohms.
			No continuity.
			About 2000 ohms.
			Perfect continuity (0 ohms).
		To measure the voltage drop of a connector, the volt meter should be connected
			in parallel, across each side of the connector
			in series, between the connector and the battery.
			in series, between the connector and the circuit load
			in parallel, between the connector and the battery.
		With all accessories turned off, the current (Parasitic) drain on the battery should be
			under 35 milliamperes.
			zero.
			under 3 amperes.
			under 100 milliamperes.
		Technician A says that a digital meter is preferred to an analog meter when measuring sensitive computer circuits. Technician B says that an analog meter might overload a computer circuit. Who is correct?
			Both Technicians A and B.
			Technician A only.
			Technician B only.
			Neither Technicians A nor B.
		Two technicians are discussing a 25% duty cycle of an electrical cooling fan. Technician A says the pulse width is 25% measured in hertz. Technican B says this indicates the fan in ON 25% and off 75% OFF the time.
			Technician B only
			Technician A only.
			Neither Technicians A nor B.
			Both Technicians A and B.
