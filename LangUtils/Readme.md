# Rapid GetText Translation

* `parse_po.php` - Extract Translation Keys from GetText PO Template
* `sep_gettext.sh` - Split an existing (partially) translated PO file into headers, keys, translations and key/string pairs.
* `po_make.php` - assemble the body of a PO file fort he target language with keys and translated strings files.

## HowTo Translate

* Using a PO/POT file of a translation template, obtain the Translation Keys
* Place the Translation Keys in a html file and use the URL in Google Translate
* Get the output of Google Translate into a Translated Strings file and correct them manually
* Use the bash file to separate out an existing translated PO file and obtain it's headers, keys, translated strings and key/string pairs.
* Compare the existing keys split by bash with and those split from the template and correct them to get a single Keys file
* Merge the original bash split header (or a newly prepared one) with the key/string pairs generated by the po_make.php script to get the final PO file
* Upload this final PO file in [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com) and review the strings and fill in the missing ones and download the proofed PO file
* Use the likes of POEdit to convert/compile this proofed PO file into a MO file and use it in the target application.
